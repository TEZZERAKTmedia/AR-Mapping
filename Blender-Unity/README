# Blender → Unity Prefab Automation Tool

This project provides a simple way to convert `.fbx` files exported from Blender into Unity `.prefab` files using CLI scripts, without needing to manually handle Unity’s editor for each asset.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

│   │   ├── FBXBatchProcessor.cs
│   │   └── ClearPrefabs.cs
│   ├── Prefabs/              # Final generated prefab files
│   └── TempImport/           # Temporary workspace for imports
├── Scripts/
│   ├── run.sh                # Runs Unity batch mode to generate prefabs
│   └── clear_prefabs.sh      # Clears existing prefabs
```

## 💠 Initial Setup

To create the folder structure:

```bash
mkdir -p Blender-Unity/{fbx,Assets/{Editor,Prefabs,TempImport},Scripts}
```

---

## 🧪 Script Details

### `FBXBatchProcessor.cs`

* Converts FBX files from `Assets/TempImport/` into `.prefab` files in `Assets/Prefabs/`.

### `ClearPrefabs.cs`

* Deletes all `.prefab` files from `Assets/Prefabs/` using Unity scripting.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Add `.fbx` Files

Export `.fbx` models from Blender and place them into:

```
Blender-Unity/Assets/TempImport/
```

---

### 2. Run the Prefab Generator

Run this from your terminal:

```bash
./Scripts/run.sh
```

It will:

* Clear existing prefabs
* Start Unity in batch mode
* Generate prefabs from `.fbx` files

---

### 3. Clear Prefabs via CLI

To delete all `.prefab` and `.meta` files:

```bash
./Scripts/clear_prefabs.sh
```

---

## 🧠 Unity Path Configuration

Edit your `run.sh` file to include your correct Unity version path:

```bash
UNITY_PATH="/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.1.4f1/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity"
```

---

## ✅ Full Workflow Example

```bash
cd Blender-Unity

# Clear existing prefabs
./Scripts/clear_prefabs.sh

# Drop FBX into import folder
cp ../model.fbx Assets/TempImport/

# Generate new prefab
./Scripts/run.sh
```

---

## 🔧 Notes

* Generated prefabs will lose their mesh reference if the original `.fbx` is deleted. Consider extracting meshes or duplicating final prefabs.
* This tool is ideal for automation or scripting workflows across teams.
