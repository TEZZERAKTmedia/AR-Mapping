# AR Mapping (Unity AR Foundation)

This repository contains a Unity project using **AR Foundation**, tested on **iPhone** with ARKit and Unity’s AR template. It is designed to demonstrate or serve as a starting point for building augmented reality features using Unity's cross-platform AR solution.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This repository is intended for personal use, version control, and development tracking. It is **not a ready-made template or starter kit**. Files may require configuration depending on your platform, device, or Unity setup.

## 🧠 What Is AR Foundation?

[AR Foundation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@latest) is a framework developed by Unity Technologies to allow cross-platform development of augmented reality experiences. It supports both ARKit (iOS) and ARCore (Android), letting you write once and deploy to both platforms (with some platform-specific configuration).



## 📱 Supported Platforms

- iOS (tested on iPhone 12 and up)
- Android (with ARCore support)
- Unity Editor (limited preview/testing via AR Simulator)

> ⚠️ iOS builds require Xcode and a valid Apple Developer profile to run on-device.

---

## 🧰 How to Get Started

### 🔧 Requirements

- **Unity Hub**
- **Unity 2020.3 LTS or newer** (this project was built on Unity `6000.1.4f1`)
- **AR Foundation** + **ARKit XR Plugin** (for iOS)
- **Xcode** (latest, for iOS builds)
- Git LFS (optional but recommended if you use large assets in future)

### 📦 Unity Packages Used

Make sure the following Unity packages are installed via **Package Manager**:

- `AR Foundation`
- `ARKit XR Plugin` (for iOS)
- `XR Interaction Toolkit` (if used)
- `Input System` (if used in code)

## 🧠 YOLOv5 → Unity Export Tool

This Unity project uses a lightweight YOLOv5 object detection model (e.g. for detecting doors in AR).  
To build and convert the trained `.pt` weights into `.onnx` format for Unity Barracuda:

From the root project directory (where this README lives), run:

```bash
bash yolov5/build_and_export_unity.sh

🎯 Training a Custom YOLOv5 Model

To train your own object detector (e.g., for detecting doors):

📁 1. Prepare Your Dataset
Your dataset should follow the standard YOLO structure:

dataset/
├── images/
│   ├── train/
│   └── val/
├── labels/
│   ├── train/
│   └── val/
└── data.yaml
Sample data.yaml:

train: ../images/train
val: ../images/val
nc: 1
names: ['door']
You can generate this format using Roboflow or manually.
🧠 2. Train the Model
From the yolov5/ folder, run:

python train.py --img 320 --batch 16 --epochs 100 --data data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --name doors_yolov5s
After training, your weights will be saved at:

yolov5/runs/train/doors_yolov5s/weights/best.pt
🔁 3. Export for Unity
From the root directory (3D UI/), simply run:

bash yolov5/build_and_export_unity.sh
The converted model will be available for use in Unity as a Barracuda NNModel.

🛠 Unity Requirements

Unity 2022+ with AR Foundation + XR Plugin
Barracuda (ONNX inference runtime)
Prefabs scaled to real-world sizes (e.g. 1m wide door)
ARRaycastManager + ARPlaneManager properly configured in scene

## 🚫 .gitignore Highlights

We’ve excluded the following to reduce bloat and avoid committing platform-specific or system-generated files:

- `Library/` — Unity cache and metadata
- `Builds*/` — Platform-specific build folders
- `mobile/Libraries/libiPhone-lib.a` — iOS binary (over 100MB, ignored to prevent GitHub push errors)
- `*.xcworkspace` and `*.xcodeproj` — Generated by Unity/iOS builds
- `Temp/`, `Logs/`, `UserSettings/` — Local config and debug files

If your project fails to build due to missing packages or files, check the **Package Manager** inside Unity and re-import what’s missing.

## ⚖️ License / Legal Notice

You are legally allowed to host Unity projects on GitHub, including AR Foundation-based projects, **as long as**:

- You **don’t include Unity binaries or proprietary packages** (`*.dll`, `libiPhone-lib.a`, etc.).
- You **don’t distribute the Unity Editor or licensed components** directly.
- Your usage follows the [Unity Terms of Service](https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service/software)

This repo adheres to those conditions by excluding platform binaries using `.gitignore`.

---

## 🛠 Future Setup Tips

- Want to build for Android? Install the **ARCore XR Plugin**.
- Using AR Session Origin or AR Raycast? Check Unity's [AR Foundation Samples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples).
